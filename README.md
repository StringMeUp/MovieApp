# MovieApp
This is a simple Movie app that uses TMDB Api. It fetches popular movies and further gets the movie of your interest, i.e. the movie details. 

It uses: MVVM, JetPack Navigation (NavHost), Room (just a display of a posible functionality to save movie for later).
It was made as an example of an "expandable" project, meaning that it can be easily modified. (adding features and being future proof)
I have also used databinding as well as bindingadapters. 
LiveData and Flow are also included with a kotlin sealed class wrapper called State.
It is and will remain a single activity app as per google guidelines.
